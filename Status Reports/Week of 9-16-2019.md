  * Created a small game in scratch. This deviates from my original strategy of small isolated exersices. The goal of this is to both show what can be done and have a bit by bit tutorial on making something a little more complex. It udemonstrates 8 of the 3rd through 5th year techniques with the potential (depending on user implemenation) of 10 at lease. The reason for this shift in approach is was continued conversation with our mentor, as I had little enphasis on fun (believing that we were only going to teach the teacher coaches rather than have those lessons be used by students). I think that this sort of activity, where students will build up to something a bit more interactive, will be more engaging. - Seth Vickers
