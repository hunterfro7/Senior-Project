## Status Report
### Date: Week of - MM/DD/YYYY
1. Project Members:
  * Benjamin Napier
  * Seth Vickers
	* Looked into adding some flavor to the Scratch projects for Lesson 4, however unless we remix 
them, we cannot edit someone else's, so for the Scratch team, rather than each doing a different section 
and ending with several remixes, I think it would be easier to each edit our own.

		* Switched mild and spicy lessons per request
		* Added the new starter files and key files
	* Clenaed the BYTE files for Lesson 3
